**Booquet** is a fully decentralized, JavaScript-based blockchain platform designed for secure and transparent event ticketing and NFT management. Built from scratch without reliance on Ethereum or Solidity, this blockchain solution enables users to buy, verify, and manage event tickets while ensuring complete prevention of black market sales, ticket duplication, and fraud.
